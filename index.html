<h2>Abstract</h2>

Low-end embedded devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming
increasingly important for our lives. They are being used in domains such
as infrastructure management, and medical and healthcare systems, where
business interests and our security and privacy are at stake. Yet, security
mechanisms have been appallingly neglected on many IoT platforms. In this
paper we present a secure access control mechanism for extremely
lightweight embedded microcontrollers. Being based on
<a href="https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/software/sancus/">Sancus</a>, a
hardware-only Trusted Computing Base and Protected Module Architecture for
the embedded domain, our mechanism allows for multiple software modules on
an IoT-node to securely share resources. We implement and evaluate our
approach for two application scenarios, a shared memory system and a shared
flash drive. Our implementation is based on a Sancus-enabled TI MSP430
microcontroller. We show that our mechanism can give high security
guarantees at small runtime overheads and a moderately increased
size of the Trusted Computing Base.
